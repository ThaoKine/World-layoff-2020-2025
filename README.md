# 🌍 World Layoffs Dashboard (2020–2025)

A data analysis and visualization project exploring global layoff trends from 2020 to 2025, focusing on **industry, funding, geography, and timing**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

To identify key patterns and risk factors associated with mass layoffs across countries, industries, and startup stages. The dashboard aims to support data-driven decisions for:

- 📊 **Investors**: Spot high-risk sectors and funding tiers  
- 👥 **HR Leaders**: Align hiring plans with business conditions  
- 🚀 **Startup Executives**: Benchmark and plan growth more sustainably  

---

## 🔍 Business Questions

- Are certain **industries or countries** more prone to layoffs?
- Do **late-stage startups** face higher layoff risks?
- Is there a link between **funding size** and layoffs?
- Are there **seasonal patterns** or peak periods of layoffs?

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Analysis**:  
  - Cleaned and processed layoff data (2020–2025) using **MySQL**  
  - Used `CASE`, `CAST`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `PARTITION BY`, and other SQL logic  
- **Visualization & Dashboarding**:  
  - Built an interactive dashboard in **Excel** using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts  
  - Highlighted key KPIs: total layoffs, top-10 countries, funding tier impacts, etc.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📅 **Layoff spikes** consistently occurred from **Jan–Apr** each year  
- 💰 **$1B+ funded** companies had the highest layoffs — overexpansion risk  
- 🏭 **Hardware**, **Retail**, and **Consumer** sectors were heavily hit  
- 🌍 **USA** accounted for the majority of layoffs — possible data bias  
- ⚠️ Funding range alone doesn't explain layoff risks — **how capital is used matters more**

---

## 🧠 Recommendations

### For Investors
- Watch for overfunded late-stage companies → high layoff risk  
- Diversify across less volatile industries  
- Use country trends as signals for macro stress  

### For HR Leaders
- Avoid overhiring after major funding rounds  
- Use timing trends to align hiring cycles  
- Learn from sector benchmarks to design resilient HR strategies  

### For Startup Founders
- Benchmark layoffs in your sector before scaling  
- Be cautious during funding jumps — growth ≠ headcount  
- Use dashboards to reflect on market positioning

## 📣 My Reflection

One of the hardest but most rewarding parts was learning to break down broad business questions into measurable sub-questions. Through trials and errors, this project helped me to think like a data analyst.
